*** multiline macros ***
are denoted with a ~ before subsequent lines
a newline between macros is enough to separate them I think?

example:

`define foo 
~ MOVI $10 %r1
~ MOVI $0 %r2




*** calling convention ***
registers %r0 to %r7 are temp
registers %r8 to %rD  (not %rA) are temp and args for the function
registers %rE to %rF are preserved 
	(is one of these a stack pointer?)

%rA is the linked register

parameter_regs = ['%r8', '%r9', '%rB', '%rC', '%rD']

returns sit in the parameter_regs



*** RAM preload ***
note, change the two constants at the beginning of the python file
RAM_START = 8192
FILE_LENGTH = 16384 
set these to be the number of lines in the file, and the start point for the RAM preload values

start ram section with 
@
DECIMAL

Then list numbers 

example:
@ #preloaded ram values
DECIMAL
0
1
2
#etc
