# ECE 3710 Project -- Wolfenstein-Style 2.5D Renderer

We developed a 2.5D rendering engine inspired by
classic Wolfenstein-style graphics, implemented on a hardware platform
based on the CR16 RISC architecture. This undertaking integrates the
design of a custom application-specific GPU, a processor extended with
application-specific accelerators and instructions, and a
purpose-built IO controller for handling user input.

This file contains a description of the project contents, including a
code listing which gives an overview of the structure of the
project. It also includes a short user guide for reproducing the
project by loading it on the Altera Terasic DE1-SoC FPGA using the
Intel Quartus/Questa software package.

## Project contents

and memory module, live in `quartusProject/`. The `quartusProject`
directory also contains a collection of Verilog test benches, test and
verification scripts, and assembly test programs. Unless prefixed by
another directory, these files all live in `quartusProject/`.

- `game.asm` is the main code to run the movement and wall
calculation algorithm.

## Introduction

The Wolfenstein-style 3D renderer is a hardware/software co-designed project that demonstrates how early 3D rendering techniques can be implemented on a modern FPGA platform. By leveraging a custom CPU, GPU pipeline, and memory-mapped I/O interfaces, the system efficiently transforms a 2D grid of walls into a compelling first-person perspective scene in real time.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time raycasting-based 3D environment rendering
- Texture-mapped walls for enhanced visual detail
- Smooth double-buffered VGA output
- Responsive joystick (Nunchuk) input for player movement and orientation
- Extensible architecture for future enhancements

## System Requirements

### Hardware Requirements
- **DE1-SoC FPGA Development Board** (Cyclone V device recommended)
- **USB Type-B cable** (for FPGA programming and power)
- **VGA-compatible display** (capable of 640x480@60Hz)
- **Arduino Uno** (or compatible microcontroller board)
- **Wii Nunchuk controller**
- **VGA cable** (HD-15 connector)

### Software Requirements
- **Intel Quartus Prime Lite (v23.1 or compatible)** with Cyclone V support
- **Arduino IDE** (latest version)
- **WiiChuck Arduino library** (installable via Arduino Library Manager)
- **USB Blaster drivers** (for FPGA programming)
- **Serial Monitor** (optional, for debugging Arduino outputs)

## Hardware Setup

1. **FPGA Board Setup**
   - Connect the DE1-SoC board to your PC using the USB Type-B cable.
   - Attach a VGA cable from the DE1-SoC VGA port to your display.
   - If powering via USB, ensure the power switch on DE1-SoC is set to USB.  
     If using an external adapter, connect it and switch to the appropriate power setting.
   - Turn on the DE1-SoC board; ensure power and configuration LEDs indicate normal operation.

2. **Arduino and Nunchuk Setup**
   - Connect the Arduino Uno to your PC via USB.
   - Wire the Wii Nunchuk to the Arduino as follows:
     ```
     Nunchuk Pin  | Arduino Pin
     -------------|------------
     VCC (3.3V)   | 3.3V
     GND          | GND
     SDA          | A4
     SCL          | A5
     ```
   - Connect Arduino’s TX pin (D1) to the specified DE1-SoC GPIO pin (mapped to GPIO_0, on JP2)
   - Confirm all connections are secure and shielded from noise.

## Software Installation

1. **Quartus Prime:**
   - Download from the Intel website.
   - Install with Cyclone V support and the USB Blaster drivers.
   - Restart your PC if prompted.

2. **Arduino IDE:**
   - Download and install the latest Arduino IDE.
   - In the Arduino IDE, open “Library Manager” and install the “WiiChuck” library.
   - Test the Arduino environment by uploading a simple “Blink” example to ensure everything is functioning correctly.

## Project Configuration

1. **FPGA Project Setup:**
   - Launch Quartus Prime.
   - Open the provided project file `GPU.qpf`.
   - Go to `Assignments -> Device` and confirm:
     - Family: Cyclone V
     - Device: 5CSEMA5F31C6 (or your specific model)
   - Use the `Pin Planner` or `Assignment Editor` to verify all pin assignments match your hardware setup (VGA pins, GPIO for Arduino serial input, etc.).

2. **Arduino Code Upload:**
   - Open `nunchuck.ino` in the Arduino IDE.
   - Select “Arduino Uno” as the board and choose the correct COM port.
   - Upload the sketch. The Arduino will now continuously read Nunchuk input and send data to the FPGA via the specified TX line.

## FPGA Programming

1. **Compiling the Project:**
   - In Quartus Prime, run the following steps:
     - Analysis & Synthesis
     - Fitter
     - Assembler
     - Timing Analysis
   - Address any errors or warnings by reviewing messages and adjusting pin assignments or constraints as needed.

2. **Programming the Device:**
   - Connect the DE1-SoC via USB Blaster (already done via the same USB cable).
   - Open the `Programmer` tool in Quartus.
   - Select “USB-Blaster” as the hardware.
   - Add the `.sof` configuration file generated by the Assembler.
   - Check “Program/Configure” and click `Start`.
   - Wait for the “100% Successful” message.

## Operation and Controls

1. **Power-On Sequence:**
   - Ensure the VGA display is connected and powered on.
   - Power on the DE1-SoC and wait for configuration to complete.
   - Verify that the VGA screen shows a startup pattern or blank display awaiting frame data.

2. **System Initialization:**
   - Press `KEY0` on the DE1-SoC board to reset the system.
   - Confirm that the Arduino is running the Nunchuk interface code and that the Nunchuk is connected.

3. **Movement and Rotation Controls:**
   - Move the Nunchuk joystick forward/backward to move the player.
   - Move the joystick left/right to rotate the player’s viewing angle.
   - The rendered scene should update each frame to reflect the player’s motion.

4. **Reset and Configuration Keys:**
   - `KEY0`: System reset.
   - Other keys currently unused but reserved for future features.

5. **LED Indicators:**
   - LEDs on the DE1-SoC may display debug patterns.
   - Specific LED patterns indicate states (e.g., frame processing, memory access). Refer to project documentation for LED pattern meanings.

## Troubleshooting

1. **No Display Output:**
   - Check VGA cable and monitor compatibility (640x480@60Hz recommended).
   - Press `KEY0` to reset.
   - Reprogram the FPGA if needed.

2. **Controller Not Responding:**
   - Check Arduino-to-FPGA connection.
   - Verify Nunchuk wiring and power.
   - Re-upload Arduino code and reset Arduino.

3. **Visual Artifacts or Flickering:**
   - Check timing constraints and VGA signal integrity.
   - Ensure double-buffering is working; poll GPU status registers before swapping.
   - Reset system if needed.

4. **Slow Performance:**
   - Reduce resolution or texture complexity.
   - Ensure no warnings during compilation that might indicate timing violations.
